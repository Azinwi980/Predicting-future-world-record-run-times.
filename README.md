**Overview:**
This project was aimed at developing a plausible model that could be used to predict athlete performance in subsequent runs. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.
Given that the outcome variable is continuous, linear regression was used and it recorded a significant performance.
**Data Understanding:**
The 'Mens Mile Run Record Progression' dataset downloaded from Kaggle consists of 7 columns and 999 rows. The columns are: index, Time, Auto, Athlete, Nationality, Date and Venue.
**Modeling and Evaluation:**
A linear regression model was used. This model recorded an R-Squared score of 96.4% with a mean absolute error of 65.7.
Below is a plot of the actual values versus the predicted values:

**Conclusion:**
The model captured most of the variability in the data. As such, it can be used by future athlete trainers to predict achievable goals.
